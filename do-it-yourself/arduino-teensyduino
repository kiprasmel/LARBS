It requires that you install arduino from the official website (arch package does not work)

After downloading the arduino.tar.xz, extracting it and running the install.sh script,
also make sure to move the arduino-x.y.z folder to /usr/share/arduino !

This then allows you to select the /usr/share/arduino folder and the installer works!


also, run this:

sudo ln -s /usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/ /usr/share/arduino/hardware/archlinux-arduino
