Since merge-3 of voidrice,
I've updated my .profile & set the following:

```
export PASSWORD_STORE_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/password-store"
```

and then also moved the $HOME/.password-store into the new location.

A few minutes later, I suppose the mailsync cronjob started,
and I got all the email notifications and stuff!!!

This is big, because previously I'd have to enter my passphrase
on every login before anything was done and that was annoying AF -
I've tried fixing it because it worked previously,
but had no success.

This just seems like it fixed it right away. da hek

I still don't fully understand this,
because doing

```
$ echo $PASSWORD_STORE_DIR
/home/kipras/.password-store
```

gives me this.

Does that mean that NOT having a password store fixes the problem?

Or is it just not updated yet, but the script already took it into effect?

I'll soon find out.
Anyhow, this is awesome. Thanks once again, @LukeSmithxyz:D Let's go!
