-> [1] https://github.com/f1u77y/web-media-controller/releases
-> [2] https://github.com/f1u77y/wmc-mpris
-> [2.1] https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/web-media-controller-mpris-git/

[1] provides the `.xpi` extension installer for firefox (install the extension, restart browser, go to youtube & play music, click on the extension button)

[2] is the `web-media-controller-mpris` util, [2.1] is it's package in AUR

[3] is the likely explanation as to why it doesn't work

The [1] is enough to fix `playerctl` for me, so not sure if [2] is needed, but I haven't yet figured out how to make the keyboard keys work in place of playerctl yet.
