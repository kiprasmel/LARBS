Also on arch, this worked for me:

    close steam, obviously.

    downgrade freetype

sudo pacman -U https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/path/freetype2-2.10.4-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst

3. start steam, and under account settings, enable the steam client beta

4. wait for the update to finish and steam to come back up, then close it again.

5. update system once more (you probably shouldn't leave freetype at the older version)
