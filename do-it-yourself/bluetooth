EDIT - see the "REVAMP" section - it works lol

---

It's actually broken..

---

take a look at ~/larbs/progs.csv

sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils pulseaudio-bluetooth

---

.Failed error:

pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover

#https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth_headset#Pairing_works,_but_connecting_does_not

or pulseaudio -k && pulseaudio --start -v

```
pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover
```

note - the first time it actually worked was when I ran `bluetoothctl` as root (`sudo su`)

edit: it works without root

---

this fixed my shit:

if `bluetoothctl` doesnt start - enable & start bluetooth service & check it's status:

```
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth --now
sudo systemctl status bluetooth
```

pulseaudio -k

thank god for https://docs.ubuntu.com/core/en/stacks/bluetooth/bluez/docs/troubleshoot/faq

if you get an error `Failed to start discovery: org.bluez.Error.NotReady`,
just do inside `bluetoothctl`:
```
power off
power on
```

---

connects and disconnects?

Then restart bluetooth.service, turn on your bluetooth adapter, make your device discoverable, re-scan for devices, and re-pair your device. Depending on your bluetooth manager, you may need to perform a full reboot in order to re-discover the device.

consider loading the modules by default https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth_headset#Pairing_works,_but_connecting_does_not

REVAMP @ 2019-07-06

I finally got it working!

There was a lot of searching involved; I've backed up my tabs in chrome's sessions @ arch/pulseaudio-bluetooth-fix
I also saved the bash history into a file available here.

Main things *I think* that helped (I did A LOT of stuff)
(See the STOW dotfiles -> pulseaudio/etc/pulse)

Since I'm dual-booting w/ Windows, I have previously paired the same device
in windows, so now I went ahead an removed it
(recommended @ arch-wiki somewhere about bluetooth / bluetooth-headset / pulseaudio (see chrome tabs))

sudo pacman -S pulseaudio-bluetooth
pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover

pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start

sudo -s
bluetoothctl
-> pair, connect

might try out

sudo rfcomm connect rfcomm0 00:14:BE:A4:0C:D4 # replace 00:14... with the MAC address of the device

(this would allow the device to stay connected,
but the device wouldn't show up in pavucontrol,
you couldn't play audio to it / hear from it)

Also, I installed & configured some stuff w/ Alsa,
and that probably helped too since the headset had
an Alsa word near it in pavucontrol.

You'll know that it works once the device shows up in `pavucontrol`

I also installed `bluez-utils-compat` form the AUR

yay -S bluez-utils-compat # this didn't work

-> I manually built it with --nocheck flag since that's what the comments suggested currently

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/bluez-utils-compat.git
cd bluez-utils-compat
makepkg -sifL --nocheck
