Encrypting $HOME directory with eCryptsfs:

essencially:

* log out
* login as root
* run this command to kill all processes of the user
```bash
killall -u <username-that-you-want-to-encrypt>
```

* verify that the user doesn't own any processes (you return no processes)
```bash
ps -U <username-that-you-want-to-encrypt>
```

* install required tools (assuming arch)

```bash
sudo pacman -S rsync lsof ecryptfs-utils
```

* prepare for encryption & start it (this will take A WHILE (I left my PC overnight))

```bash
modprobe ecryptfs
ecryptfs-migrate-home -u <username-that-you-want-to-encrypt>
```

* after that - follow the instructions.

	* I had to do the following (auto unmounting failed after encryption):

((NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART - only do it if the instructions tell you that unmounting failed))
```bash
killall -u kipras
umount /home/kipras
```

	* then, if instructions tell you that you can `keyctl unlink`, do the following:

```bash
keyctl show
```

	* select a keyring's session (first parameter probably) (you might need to try them all) & run
```bash
keyctl unlink <the-session-id>
```
	>>> do this until you get at least 1 key removed

---

* next - precisely follow the auto-mounting setup (untill ecryptfs-simple):
	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ECryptfs#Auto-mounting

---

* login as the user who's directory has been encrypted
* verify that everything is working
* log out and log in as root.
	* verify that the output of `mount` does NOT contain a mountpoint with your username
```bash
mount | grep <username-you-encrypted>
```

	>>> should NOT return a mount point

	* cd to the <username-you-encrypted>
	* make sure that you files are NOT present and that a readme exists, explaining the encryption

* log out, log back in as <username-you-encrypted>
* verify that files are accessable & that `mount | grep <username-you-encrypted>` DOES have a mountpoint

>>> it works!

Once everything is working, the unencrypted backup of the users home directory,
which is saved to /home/username.random_characters, can and should be deleted.
