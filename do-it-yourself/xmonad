# --lib very important!
cabal install xmonad xmonad-contrib --lib

must have the terminal that's configured in the ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs (default xterm, I switched to st)

# do
xmonad --recompile

# then, in a separate tty that's not currently running a window manager, either:
	# a) via startx
	# b) via ~/.xinitrc

# a)
startx /home/$USER/.xmonad/xmonad-x86_64-linux # <-- path of the compiled executable!

# b)
# in the very end of it, add:
exec /home/$USER/.xmonad/xmonad-x86_64-linux # <-- path of the compiled executable!



# xmobar
cabal install xmobar --lib
